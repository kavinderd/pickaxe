#[Programming Ruby](http://pragprog.com/book/ruby4/programming-ruby-1-9-2-0)

This repo contains my notes and an accompanying project for this book. The aim of this repo is to help my own comprehension and retention of the material.

###How it works

There is one folder named 'project' and another named 'notes', The project does not reference any particular chapter or part of the book, but rather is an exercise in applying what I learn to a complete project. 

The notes folder contains my notes on each chapter arranged as per the table of contents.

###Notes

Notes for every chapter answer the following questions:

-What did I learn?
-What problems were addressed?
-What other solutions exist?
-How can I apply this knowledge?
-How can I extend this knowledge?
-What don't I understand?
-Can I explain what I learned?
-Have I mastered what I learned?
-What abstract concepts did this chapter/lesson cover?

I intend to answer every question after each chapter, but depending on the content I may omit some.
